# Report:

In this meeting, the scrum master along with developer team showed me the final completed project, they ran the project, made sure that each and every function was working well and the UI was to my liking as it was my choice to choose the design and I got to see it after every sprint was completed so I have no complaints there. Overall, the project was fully functional, everything was working well, and every condition was met and every sprint completed, there were some delays in some sprints but since they completed the project and presented it to me on time it is okay. This was out last meeting and the last sprint will be uploaded to GitHub by the developers and the final project as a whole would be submitted by me to Canvas.
